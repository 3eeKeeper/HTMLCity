SimCity Network Edition Comprehensive Research Report & Development Plan
Introduction
This comprehensive research report examines SimCity Network Edition, specifically the SimCity 2000
Network Edition released in 1996 by Maxis. This research is crucial for the development of a new game
inspired by SimCity Network Edition, as it provides valuable insights into the gameplay mechanics,
development process, design choices, network architecture, player experience, and market reception of
the original title. Understanding these elements will help create a successful modern adaptation that
captures the essence of the original while implementing innovative features.
1. Gameplay Features
Core Mechanics
SimCity 2000 Network Edition maintained the core city-building simulation mechanics of the original
SimCity 2000 but added multiplayer functionality. The gameplay remained very similar to SimCity 2000
with no new buildings or features added to the base game. Players still needed to develop residential,
commercial, and industrial areas, build infrastructure, and manage city services.
However, the Network Edition introduced a significant change to the land management system: players
now had to purchase land before developing it, with purchases going through an escrow period before
becoming available. This added a new strategic layer to gameplay, as players could also sell land back at
a profit if its value had increased due to development.
Multiplayer Aspects
The multiplayer functionality was the defining feature of SimCity Network Edition. Up to four players
could participate in a game via LAN or online by connecting to a host player's IP address. The game
offered several multiplayer modes:
1. Co-op play: Multiple players could manage a single city together
2. Connected cities: Players could create separate cities that shared resources
3. Competitive play: Players could compete against each other for territory and resources
Players could communicate through an in-game chat system, create contracts to swap resources, and
vote collectively on city ordinances. This added a diplomatic element to the game that was absent from
the single-player version.
The server window gave the host substantial control over the game, including options to modify and
save files, disable disasters, and set game speed. The host could also manage players by granting them
money, temporarily disconnecting them, or wiping their progress.
City Management Systems
The city management systems largely mirrored those in SimCity 2000, with the addition of multiplayer-
specific features. Players still needed to balance residential, commercial, and industrial development,
provide utilities, manage transportation networks, and maintain public services.
The game retained the traditional demolition techniques and natural disasters from SimCity 2000,
though with fewer disaster types available, likely to reduce network strain.
Economic Models
The economic model was enhanced to accommodate multiplayer gameplay. Players started with more
money in network mode than in single-player games, allowing them to purchase land immediately and
begin development.
The game introduced proposal contracts, allowing players to negotiate the provision or exchange of
essential services like medical facilities and resources like electricity. This created an economic
interdependence between players, adding depth to the multiplayer experience.
Environmental Factors
Environmental management remained similar to SimCity 2000, with players needing to balance
development with environmental concerns. However, the disaster system was significantly modified,
with only four disaster types available, possibly to reduce lag in multiplayer games.
2. Development Process
Team Structure
While specific information about the development team is limited, we know that SimCity 2000 was
jointly developed by Will Wright and Fred Haslam of Maxis. The Network Edition was developed after
the release of SimCity 2000, with Maxis handling the adaptation to multiplayer functionality.
The Windows port of SimCity 2000 Network Edition was developed by Mark A. Pietras, Micheal A. Pitts,
and James R. Thomas.
Tools and Technologies Used
SimCity 2000 Network Edition was developed specifically for Windows 95, utilizing its networking
capabilities. The game contained both client and server programs to facilitate multiplayer functionality.
The game supported Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) for automatic port configuration, making it easier
for players to connect to each other.
Timeline and Milestones
The development timeline appears to have been as follows:
1993: Original SimCity 2000 released for Macintosh and MS-DOS
1995: SimCity 2000 Special Edition (CD Collection) released
1996: SimCity 2000 Network Edition released for Windows 95
Challenges and Solutions
The development team faced several challenges in adapting SimCity 2000 for multiplayer functionality:
1. Adapting land ownership for multiplayer: The solution was requiring land to be purchased before
development, allowing clear delineation of player territories.
2. Network performance: The team reduced the number of available disasters to possibly minimize lag
and synchronization issues.
3. Compatibility issues: The game had problems running on Windows NT kernel-based operating
systems, requiring third-party patches to function properly.
3. Game Design
Visual Style and Aesthetics
The visual style remained largely unchanged from SimCity 2000, maintaining the isometric view and
detailed sprite-based graphics. However, the user interface was redesigned to match the Windows 95
aesthetic, replacing the Macintosh-like design of the original SimCity 2000.
User Interface Design
The user interface was significantly redesigned to accommodate multiplayer features and align with
Windows 95 design principles. The server window provided host controls for managing the game and
players, while the chat window allowed for communication between players.
Instead of a static toolbar, the Network Edition featured cascading menus from the right side of the
screen, increasing the viewable area for the city itself without sacrificing functionality.
Sound Design and Music
While specific information about sound design changes is limited, it appears that the audio elements
remained largely unchanged from SimCity 2000.
Level Design
The game maintained the open-ended, player-created level design of SimCity 2000, with no pre-
designed cities or scenarios specifically created for the Network Edition. However, the package included
the "Urban Renewal Kit" and "New Scenarios" that were originally part of the SimCity 2000 CD
Collection.
4. Network Architecture
Multiplayer Implementation
SimCity 2000 Network Edition featured a client-server architecture where one player would host the
game (server) and others would connect (clients). The game supported up to four players connecting via
LAN or direct IP connection.
Players could connect through three methods: LAN for up to four players, modem-to-modem for two
players, or internet connection to a dedicated online server for three players.
Server Infrastructure
The server component was run by a host player rather than dedicated servers maintained by Maxis. The
host controlled game settings, including speed, disasters, and player management. The server did not
automatically pause when all players logged out, allowing the game to continue running.
Data Synchronization Methods
While detailed technical information about data synchronization is not available, the game presumably
used a centralized synchronization method where the host server maintained the authoritative game
state. Features like the reduced disaster set suggest optimizations were made to minimize data transfer
and synchronization issues.
5. Player Experience
Learning Curve
The learning curve for SimCity 2000 Network Edition combined the already complex city management
of SimCity 2000 with new multiplayer concepts. The game was described as "essentially SimCity 2000
with a few gameplay enhancements and features that elevate it to the network level of amusement,"
suggesting that players familiar with the original game could adapt relatively quickly to the network
version.
Engagement Factors
Several elements contributed to player engagement:
1. Collaborative city building: The ability to work together on a single city created a unique cooperative
experience.
2. Competitive elements: Though not designed as a combat-focused game, players could compete for
land and resources, and even sabotage each other's developments through strategic demolition.
3. Negotiation and diplomacy: The contract system allowed players to engage in resource trading and
service provision agreements.
Social Interactions
The game featured an in-game chat system that displayed both player messages and game
notifications. If a message was received while the chat window was closed, it would automatically open.
Players could communicate to coordinate development, negotiate resource sharing, and engage in
friendly competition.
Replayability
The game's replayability derived from the variety of multiplayer scenarios possible:
1. Different combinations of players and play styles
2. Various approaches to city development (cooperative or competitive)
3. Different land configurations and resource distributions
4. The inherent replayability of the SimCity 2000 base game
6. Marketing and Reception
Target Audience
SimCity 2000 Network Edition was primarily targeted at existing SimCity fans looking for a multiplayer
experience, rather than trying to attract players from faster-paced strategy games like WarCraft II or
Command & Conquer.
Marketing Strategies
Marketing information is limited, but the game was advertised in the radio stations of a later Maxis title,
Streets of SimCity, suggesting cross-promotion within Maxis' game portfolio.
Critical Reception
Reviews described the game as an interesting extension of SimCity 2000 that added multiplayer
functionality without dramatically changing the core gameplay. Critics appreciated the new property
management system and multiplayer features but noted that it wasn't a fast-paced network game like
other contemporary titles.
Player Feedback
Unfortunately, the game appears to have been commercially unsuccessful, being discontinued after
only a year due to poor sales. Copies of the game became very rare due to limited distribution.
The game's compatibility issues with newer operating systems likely contributed to its limited long-term
appeal, though third-party patches were eventually developed to allow the game to run on modern
systems.
